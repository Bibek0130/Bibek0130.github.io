        "given_string = 'Human beings believe that they live their life in a conscious manner; that they are aware of their surroundings and know what is going on around them at all times. Yet deeper analysis of the word conscious leads to a more confusing thought process than a human being may be able to grasp. The Personal and Collective Unconscious by Carl Jung believes that “the unconscious contains only those parts of the personality which could just as well be conscious and are in fact suppressed only through upbringing”(344). In a more simplistic form, he says that the human brain is actually a more unconscious thought process and that what the brain produces to be conscious can actually be described as unconscious. Francis Crick’s The General Nature of …show more content… Jung states that “the unconscious contains all those psychic components that have fallen below the threshold, including subliminal sense perceptions”(344-345). The honest answer for most people would be no, and thus reinforcing the belief that our unconsciousness, at least, controls part of what we describe and believe to be conscious. This is a theory that both Jung and Crick believe in, and have written to great length on at support their own hypotheses. Crick goes into great length to tell his readers that psychology is at a loss and in a great dispute about what, in fact, the conscious and unconscious truly are. Crick states that even though humans live in a state of total awareness all of their life, except when asleep, that even if they think that the body and mind are controlled by the conscious, the mind spends more time performing more unconscious thoughts and processes than it does performing the conscious ones. He believes that the brain only makes things seem to be conscious for our own sakes of grasping what occurs around us.'\n"
